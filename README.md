# Iris-Flower-Classification

The problem is comprised of 150 observations of iris flowers from three different species.

Classification is done on features:
  1.sepal length
  2.sepal width
  3.petal length
  4.petal width (all in the same unit of centimeters).

The predicted attribute is the species, which is one of Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor or Iris-virginica.

This Project is thorugh application of machine learning with python programming. It focuses on IRIS flower classification using Machine Learning with scikit tools. Here some of algorithm are used that are some types of machine learning subparts algorithms of supervised and Unsupervised learning. Algorithm used for predicting and get accuracy are -

  1.Dicision tree classifier

  2.K nearest classifier

  3.Logistic Regression
  We are making accuracy and prediction in Iris project through Iris Dataset.
